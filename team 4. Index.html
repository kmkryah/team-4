		<p text align="center" class="storyparagraphs">College is not just about tests and homework, it's about learning how to be an adult. While the experience isn't the same for everyone, the stereotypical process involves leaving the comfort of parental domain and entering the realm of personal responsibility. The first leg of this journey is usually a dorm, but the next step for many is an even bigger leap into the "real world:" off-campus living.</p>
		<p text align="center" class="storyparagraphs">This leap could turn into a pitfall, though, if tensions between landlords and tenants arise. Unfortunately, this is not a rare occasion.<p>

		<h1>Good relationship</h1>
		<p class="storyparagraphs">Not every off-campus experience is a horror story, though. Katie Wright, a University of Oregon student, said she's always had a good relationship with her landlord.</p>
		<p class="storyparagraphs">"You treat them with respect, Wright said regarding landlords. "They're living here too, with a bunch of college students - respect them and their space."</p>
		<p class="storyparagraphs">While Wright's experiences have been mostly pleasant, she does know people who have had bad relationships with their landlords. She didn't place the blame on one party or the other, though.</p>
		<p class="storyparagraphs">I think it's both," Wright said. "You can't just blame one side, it's a two way street."</p>
		<p class="storyparagraphs">While tales of woe exist on the extreme end of the spectrum, for the most part, students like Wright still want to live off campus. A new study from Ball State University concluded that college students from six different college markets would willingly pay 16 percent more in order to live in an off-campus apartment.</p>

		<h1>Bad relationship</h1>
		<p class="storyparagraphs">Such experiences haven't been limited to intrepid Wildcats venturing into Evanston, though. Ball State students Katie Reece and Katelyn Miller were in the process of looking for an apartment when they had seemingly found the perfect match. Upon reading the finer points of the lease, though, Reece and Miller discovered that the landlord had included several restrictive clauses. For one, and appliance or electronic device had to be approved by the landlord. What's more, the two girls couldn't have overnight guests over unless they secure the landlord's permission. Faced with those options, they decided not to sign the lease.</p>
		<p class="storyparagraphs">Not all students may have this luxury. U.S. News revealed that, thanks to a 38.7 percent increase in student enrollment between 2000 and 2010, many colleges are not able to provide housing for students for all four years. In effect, this makes the off-campus housing market a seller's game.</p>
		<p class="storyparagraphs">No universal legislation exists to govern landlord-tenant relationships. Rather, tenant rights differ from state to state are listed by the U.S. department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>

		<h1>Worst case</h1>
		<p class="storyparagraphs">Coping mechanisms have a breaking point though, and the consequences of a complete communications breakdown can be severe. Emily Burklow, a Weinberg Junior, had to experience the failures of a dysfunctional landlord/tenant relationship firsthand.</p>
		<p class="storyparagraphs">Before Burklow even moved in to her house last Summer, there was trash leftover from previous tenants, leaking faucets and broken smoke detectors. Because she was studying abroad, Burklow's roommates were the first to encounter their landlord about the problems.</p>
		<p class="storyparagraphs"> by a neighbor as a "terrible landlord," Burklow attempted to contact her landlord throughout the summer about the mounting issues, including carpenter ants and a door broken off of its hinges. The landlord sent only "cold, unhelpful answers" and allegedly didn't take action to fix problems. Contacting the Off-Campus Life office didn't help either.</p>
		<p class="storyparagraphs">Things only got worse. The basement flooded once in the winter and twice in the spring. The stove broke. Repeated emails to the landlord were ignored. Burklow called her landlord an "unstable character," citing the landlordâ€™s unexpected trip to Thailand and her insinuation that she wasn't responsible for repairs.</p>
		<p class="storyparagraphs">"Because she's so evasive, it's hard to expect a middle ground with her," Burklow said.</p>
		<p class="storyparagraphs">When enough was enough, Burklow and her roommates attempted to set up an in-person meeting with their landlord. When they couldn't contact her, one roommate's mother began acting as a lawyer and initiated contact with the landlord in a legal context. While emailing with a lawyer attached ended up solving some of the problems, a lawsuit has progressed regarding other unsolved problems in the house.</p>
		<p class="storyparagraphs">In retrospect, Burklow said that treating everything as urgent from the first moment she and her roommates moved in would've helped. Instead, they've had to pick and choose their battles in the months that followed.</p>
		<p class="storyparagraphs">"We don't know what landlord-tenant relationships are supposed to look like," Burklow said. "Our parents were the ones who had to tell us to get stuff fixed."</p>
