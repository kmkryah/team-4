		<p text align="center" id="storyparagraphs">College is not just about tests and homework, it's about learning how to be an adult. While the experience isn't the same for everyone, the stereotypical process involves leaving the comfort of parental domain and entering the realm of personal responsibility. The first leg of this journey is usually a dorm, but the next step for many is an even bigger leap into the "real world:" off-campus living.</p>
		<p text align="center" id="storyparagraphs">This leap could turn into a pitfall, though, if tensions between landlords and tenants arise. Unfortunately, this is not a rare occasion.<p>

		<h1>Good relationship</h1>
		<p id="storyparagraphs">Not every off-campus experience is a horror story, though. Katie Wright, a University of Oregon student, said she's always had a good relationship with her landlord.</p>
		<p id="storyparagraphs">"You treat them with respect, Wright said regarding landlords. "They're living here too, with a bunch of college students - respect them and their space."</p>
		<p id="storyparagraphs">While Wright's experiences have been mostly pleasant, she does know people who have had bad relationships with their landlords. She didn't place the blame on one party or the other, though.</p>
		<p id="storyparagraphs">I think it's both," Wright said. "You can't just blame one side, it's a two way street."</p>
		<p id="storyparagraphs">While tales of woe exist on the extreme end of the spectrum, for the most part, students like Wright still want to live off campus. A new study from Ball State University concluded that college students from six different college markets would willingly pay 16 percent more in order to live in an off-campus apartment.</p>

		<h1>Bad relationship</h1>
		<p id="storyparagraphs">Such experiences haven't been limited to intrepid Wildcats venturing into Evanston, though. Ball State students Katie Reece and Katelyn Miller were in the process of looking for an apartment when they had seemingly found the perfect match. Upon reading the finer points of the lease, though, Reece and Miller discovered that the landlord had included several restrictive clauses. For one, and appliance or electronic device had to be approved by the landlord. What's more, the two girls couldn't have overnight guests over unless they secure the landlord's permission. Faced with those options, they decided not to sign the lease.</p>
		<p id="storyparagraphs">Not all students may have this luxury. U.S. News revealed that, thanks to a 38.7 percent increase in student enrollment between 2000 and 2010, many colleges are not able to provide housing for students for all four years. In effect, this makes the off-campus housing market a seller's game.</p>
